## Yet More Git Practice!
- Check your email for an invitation to join the "easley-students" group. You'll have to click the link in the invitation email to join properly.
- Copy the SSH clone clone address for the repo at 
- `cd ~/codeup-data-science` 
- Now clone this repo to your laptop in this folder.
- cd into the new folder
- Use VS Code to create a new file named firstname_lastname.md (where your_name is actually your own first name...)
- Add some text to that file that shares something you've learned about git or the command line.
- Add, commit, and push your work.
- If you get a prompt to "git pull" do a git pull before trying to push again (this means you need to download someone else's work before pushing your own)
