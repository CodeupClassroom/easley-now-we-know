## Here is some info on what I have learned about github & command line so far

<h2>My name is David...</h2>

*and* I have enjoyed learning the **command line** and **github**

<h3>Here is a quick list of what I enjoy about Command Line</h3>

- The letters C, D, L, A, M, K, D, R are now some of my favorite of the alphabet
- I enjoy the freedom to move about my computer using key commands in the terminal
- *CTRL-L* is useful in cleaing up my terminal if it has a lot of text

<h3>Now for a few Github favorites</h3>

- I **love** :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:  when I push new commits up to the web and see it successful
- git status
    - git diff
        - git add
            - git status
                - git commit -m " "
                    - git push

- I woke up this morning and realized there is an additional love that I have for github...
    - :green_square: :green_square: :green_square: :green_square: :green_square: :green_square:
- Yes. I have a small crush on the green box that shows at least one commit was completed.
