### Shortcuts I've learned: 
- Use tab to autocomplete directory or file names
- Use Ctrl-C - ends processing
- Use Ctrl-L to clear terminal, but still be able to scroll up and down through your commands
- the ~ key navigates to your home directory
- git diff will show you the changes since your last commit


- use markdown codes to format your md files
